* added json converter with tests

0.5.3 (2009-01-22)
------------------

Reverting previous fix.. convert should leave None along in both directions.

0.5.2 (2009-01-17)
------------------

BUG FIX: string converters ``from_type``s were returning None - should always
         be an empty string

BUG FIX: string converters ``to_type``s were checking for None - they should
         expect an empty string for an none representation
